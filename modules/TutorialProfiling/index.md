# Profiling Tutorial

This repositiory is designed to help with the process of examining and fixing the performance of Terasology. The wiki contains information about the process of using Java FlightRecorder to record and examine the game's performance. The module itself contains examples of common performance issues and how to fix them, which are explained in detail in the wiki. For now, there is a single placeholder command. Performance examples are implemented using commands, with the syntax `testPerformanceExampleName <boolean efficient>` where `ExampleName` is the name of the example and `efficient` controls whether to run the good or bad version of the example.
