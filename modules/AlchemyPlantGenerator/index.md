# Overview
AlchemyPlantGenertor is a simple module for spawning plants from the Alchemy module into the world using a plugin. Note: Because it is a plugin, this module doesn't contain a world generator. You *plug in* this module to your generator. Hence the name.

# Dependencies
Just [Alchemy](https://github.com/Terasology/Alchemy), really.
