## Tutorial Snake Tournament

A tutorial module simulating the classic snake game where two slithering opponents attempt to crash each other into a wall.

As the player moves forward, they leave a trail of blocks behind (resembling a snake from an aerial view). Every time they move to another block, the previous one is filled in, so the snake gets longer and longer. The player loses if they have no adjacent blocks to move in to.

See the wiki for a walkthrough on creating this module: http://github.com/Terasology/SnakeTournament/wiki
