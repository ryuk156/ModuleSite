# TutorialBlockFamily
This repo is for helping new Terasologists understand the new block family system. The code in this module is completely functional and there is a full walkthrough/tutorial of the code in this repo's [wiki](https://github.com/Terasology/BlockFamilyTutorial/wiki).

# Finished Product
Here are some pictures of the finished "arrow" block family:

This block family doesn't really have a good use in-game, but it serves as a great example of how to make a custom block family that changes it's texture based on the blocks around it.
