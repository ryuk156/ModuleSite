The CoreAssets module contains basic prefabs, block definitions and further assets that are required by other modules, like sounds, templates, and textures.

CoreAssets was separated from the [Core](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/tree/develop/modules/Core) to make the modules more versatile.
