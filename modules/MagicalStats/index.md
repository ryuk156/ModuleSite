MagicalStats
============

This module adds a basic RPG stats system consisting of several different magical attributes or stats. Plus, a system for
modifying these stats is in place.

These attributes are the following:

* Intelligence (INT) - Affects magic damage (not implemented).
* Wisdom (WIS) - Affects mana amount (not implemented).
* Willpower (WIL) - Affects mana regeneration speed (not implemented).
* Arcane resistance (RES) - Affects magic resistance (not implemented).

This module is intended to be extended by other modules for more complex interactions.
