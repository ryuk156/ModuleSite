There are some quirks to work out with converting Blender's\ndata structures to Terasology's block shape structure; since Blender stores all the UV and normal data per <em>face</em> instead\nof per <em>vertex,</em> it may need an update or two to the .shape format. But, if all goes as planned, all the old .shape files\nwill still work fine <em>(no need for another massive file conversion like when all the blocks in the Core module got moved\nto CoreBlocks!)</em> and new .shape files will be able to handle multiple UV locations per vertex. <em>(In words that less geeky,\nthat means we'll be able to have more advanced textures and lighting for blocks with complex shapes. Shiny shiny.)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/270264625419911192/666236136057733150/unknown.png\" alt=\"Inferno!\" style=\"width:800px;padding:8px\">\n<ul>\n<li>Pardon me for being blunt... but if you download this module update, you can go to hell. No, really -- it's once again\npossible to visit iojw's fiery <a href=\"https://github.com/Terasology/Inferno/pull/8\">Inferno</a> now that Torpedo99 has fixed the spawning mechanism! You might ask, <em>how do you\nexpect me to travel to this dimension of shadow and lava? You don't really expect me to construct some sort of portal,\ndo you?</em> No, Mr. Goo, I expect you to die.

We're still a long way out from having\nprocedurally-generated animal species, so no, you still won't be able to hunt down a South Ecuadorian Giant Laser Shark\nany time soon. <em>(Nor do you have to worry about being hunted down by any South Ecuadorian Giant Laser Sharks. Unless you're\nexploring evil lairs in South Ecuador, of course.)</em> But if you want to make <a href=\"https://github.com/Terasology/DynamicCities\">cities</a> or NPCs that have names from Ancient\nGreece, Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt, medieval Japan, modern Hindi, or a few other cultures, you'll soon be able to grab\nthem from the new templates.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Thus concludes the second TeraSaturday changeblog. Hopefully, despite its shortness, it has still been sweet. <em>(If not,\nI recommend a banana.)</em> Enjoy the game, and I'll be back for another update next week!</p>\n<!-- References -->","timeToRead":3,"excerpt":"Welcome to the sequel edition of TeraSaturday, a weekly update post about all the neat stuff that has been going on in\n the world of…","frontmatter":{"title":"TeraSaturday #2","ddate":"Feb 1st, 2020","tags":"TeraSaturday","author":"Jordan H.
