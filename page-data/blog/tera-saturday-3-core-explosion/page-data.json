Basic world generators,\nthe inventory system, grass and stone and trees and chests and all that fun stuff. Even dynamite! There was a bit of a\nproblem, though, in that not every game mode <em>needs</em> all those things. They might use a completely different world\ngenerator, or have a different inventory system, or they don't want to have players blowing things up. So about a year\nand a half ago, we began mining out the Core.</p>\n<p>Jellysnake separated <a href=\"https://github.com/Terasology/Inventory\">Inventory</a> from Core, and Adrijaned pulled out Biomes. <a href=\"https://github.com/Terasology/Health\">Health</a> got its own fresh new module thanks\nto e-aakash. I pulled out all the world blocks, creating the CoreBlocks module, and CoreAssets for the textures and\nsounds they used. That was a big project, requiring updates to over 50 different modules!</p>\n<p>This was <em>bigger.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/696830442065625118/712674385391255562/unknown.png\" alt=\"just a small part of the changes!\"></p>\n<p>Taking the extraction to its logical conclusion, Skaldarnar and Niruandaleth have completely removed the Core module.\nCoreBlocks has been blown up, too. In their place, a new network of modules stretches across the workspace, each\nproviding a specific subset of functionality for the Core Gameplay preset.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qBHbynr.png\" alt=\"New Core Module Diagram\" style=\"width:800px;padding:8px\">\n<p>The old Inventory and LootPools modules, used to keep track of items, have been mixed together and separated again,\nforming a refreshed <a href=\"https://github.com/Terasology/Inventory\">Inventory</a> module and a new <a href=\"https://github.com/Terasology/Drops\">Drops</a> module.</p>\n<p>CoreBlocks has been divided and conquered. Basic blocks like dirt, stone, sand, and wood have gone directly into\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Terasology/CoreAssets\">CoreAssets</a>, while fancy blocks like chests and doors and TNT have gone into <a href=\"https://github.com/Terasology/CoreAdvancedAssets\">CoreAdvancedAssets</a>.\n<em>(Yes, the name is still a work in progress.)</em></p>\n<p>The new modules of <a href=\"https://github.com/Terasology/Furnishings\">Furnishings</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Terasology/Explosives\">Explosives</a> hold the game logic that those fancy blocks need to work, so other modules\ncan make their own storage, doors, or bombs without needing to keep the basic versions around too. All the\nworld-builders have been moved to the aptly-named <a href=\"https://github.com/Terasology/CoreWorlds\">CoreWorlds</a>. All together, <a href=\"https://github.com/Terasology/CoreAssets\">CoreSampleGameplay</a> combines this new\ncollection of modules into the same base gameplay setting that existed before.</p>\n<p>If you're just playing the game, you probably won't notice much of a difference before and after. But for module\ndevelopers, it opens a lot of doors (and chests!) for making more cool stuff, more efficiently.</p>\n<!-- References -->","timeToRead":2,"excerpt":"Welcome to the return of TeraSaturday, a not-so-weekly update post about all the neat stuff that has been going on in \nthe world ofâ€¦","frontmatter":{"title":"TeraSaturday #3: Core Explosion","ddate":"May 30th, 2020","tags":"TeraSaturday","author":"Jordan H.
